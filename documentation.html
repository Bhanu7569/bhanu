    <h1>1. Div Tag</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Div tag in HTML is a versatile container used to group and structure
            content. It has no inherent styling and is often used with CSS for layout
            purposes. The name "div" stands for division, emphasizing its role in
            dividing and organizing page elements.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>
                HTML is an inline container used to apply styles or script to a specific portion of text. Unlike div it doesn't create a new block but wraps around small content within a line. It's handy for targeted styling or scripting within a larger text block.

            The `id` attribute in HTML is used to uniquely identify a specific element on a webpage, facilitating targeted styling or scripting.
